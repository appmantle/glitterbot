Glitterbot is a free and open source [Slack](http://slack.com) bot. The bot improves your team's productivity by boosting your teams morale each morning. Glitterbot accomplishes this morale boost by posting a new Glitterplaatje at the start of each day.

### After adopting Glitterbot, how much more productive is your team?

> Glitterbot has greatly improved our teams morale. It makes our employees feel like their work has a higher purpose. Each new Glitterplaatje gives us a way to to recognize our team members for a job well done.

### What Glitterbot looks like

## Usage
You can host the Glitterplaatjes on your own web server, or use the Appmantle Glitter CDN as the source for the images. The Glitter CDN will always be up-to-date allowing you and your team to receive the latest and greatest Glitterplaatjes.

This bot is written in JavaScript and requires Node.js to run.

### Setup
1. Create a new coming webhook on slack and select the channel you want your Glitterplaatjes to be send to
2. Clone Glitterbot to your own machine
3. Install all dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Open `glitterbot.js` and set the URL of the webhook you just made in `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
4. Start the bot using `node glitterbot.js`


### Using your own images
If you don't like the Glitterplaatjes (What?!), Glitterbot can also send your team your own custom images. 

1. Replace the images in the `public` folder with your own images
  **Make sure to maintain the excisting folder structure.** Place images meant for specific days in the folders for these days (`public/mon` for monday, `public/tue` for tuesday). Place generic images that could be sent on any morning in the `public/generic` folder.
2. Run `node images.js` to generate a new `images.json` for your images.
3. Upload the images.json file and all images to your own server
4. Change the path of the image host to your own server in `glitterbot.js`

### Configuration
In glitterbot.js you can change these settings:
Setting | Usage
`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | The URL of your incoming Slack webhook. You can configure these for in the [Slack App Directory](slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations)
`IMAGE_SOURCE` | The path to where images.json and all images are hosted. By default this is our Glitter CDN.
`CRON` | The CRON expression used determine when Glitterplaatjes should be sent. By default this is on weekdays at 9:00. If you want to receive Glitterplaatjes every day, change this to `00 09 * * *`.
